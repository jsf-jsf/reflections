How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area has newly added uncommitted files only.  working directory is where your working files are.  Repository is where you commit your changes

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I'm trying something new, experimental, or something that will take a long time to finish.  Branches will help as I will reduce the risk of bringing in bad untested changes.
