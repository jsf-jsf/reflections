How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped me quickly figure out what changed between the versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can go back and see what changes you made a long time ago, when you probably forgot your thought process, or if a bug is found that was introduced many versions ago.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros:  logical points versus middle of doing something
Cons:  May forget to do it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because in programming, files are connected, while in Google Docs they are most of the time not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log allows you to see all the commits with the commit message.
git diff allows you to see the differences line by line between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I know that I could always revert to an older commit if I messed up.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Making changes to files, commit them, etc.
